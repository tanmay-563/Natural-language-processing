## 📌 Overview  
**ReviewScope** is an NLP-powered dashboard for analyzing **customer reviews** using state-of-the-art transformer models. The project leverages **RoBERTa**, a transformer-based model, fine-tuned on customer review datasets to classify sentiment (positive, neutral, negative) and extract meaningful insights from unstructured feedback.  

This tool provides businesses and researchers with a way to:  
- Understand **customer sentiments** at scale.  
- Detect hidden trends in textual reviews.  
- Visualize the data with an interactive **Streamlit dashboard**.

## ⚙️ Training & Fine-tuning  

The model powering **ReviewScope** is based on **RoBERTa-base**, which was fine-tuned for sentiment classification.  

### 🔹 Steps Involved:
1. **Dataset Preparation**  
   - Cleaned raw datasets (`Reviews.csv`, `sample.csv`)  
   - Removed noise, punctuation, and stopwords.  
   - Balanced positive, neutral, and negative samples.  

2. **Model Fine-tuning**  
   - Used **Hugging Face Transformers** library.  
   - Pretrained `roberta-base` model was loaded.  
   - Added a classification head (`nn.Linear`) for 3-way sentiment classification.  
   - Optimizer: AdamW with weight decay.  
   - Learning rate scheduling with warmup.  
   - Training performed for **3 epochs** with early stopping.  

3. **Evaluation**  
   - Metrics: Accuracy, F1-Score, Precision, Recall.  
   - Visualizations: Confusion matrix, loss curves.  
   - Achieved ~90% accuracy on test samples.  

4. **Model Export**  
   - Saved as `pytorch_model.bin` with `config.json`, `vocab.json`, and `merges.txt`.  
   - Stored in the `roberta_model/` folder for reuse in the Streamlit app.
